# Sprint 1 Report (03/01/2026)
## What's New (User Facing)
* Login and Register Page
* User Preference Page
* Events Page
* Map Interface
* Database Connection

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

We brought our project from the documentation phase to an actual testable program
with the most fundemental components present (map display, login, profile/event modifications)
None of us had much experience with Flutter or full-stack development, but reading
through documentation and jumping into UI design and small test projects helped us overcome this barrier.
Similarly, some of us were less experienced with version control, but after opening pull requests and contributing
our changes, we have established an effecient workflow. Lastly, we weren't sure what database approach to 
go with, testing cloud-based firebase, but SQLite was our decided route as it is easiest to navigate 
in the repo and troubleshoot.
